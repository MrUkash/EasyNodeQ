EasyNodeQ
=========

Intended to simplify and clarify the use of RabbitMQ, EasyNodeQ is a NodeJS implementation of and built to be interoperable with, the interactions created in Mike Hadlow's EasyNetQ which can be found [here](https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ) and [here](http://easynetq.com/).

This project relies heavily on amqp.node (amqplib), which can be found [here](https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node) and [here](http://www.squaremobius.net/amqp.node/).
